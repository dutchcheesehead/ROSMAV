ROSMAV

To install ROSMAV, first install ROS:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu

Next do:

	./install.sh

ARDrone Brown and cmvision are now installed.

ROSMAV itself needs no further installation, it can be run right from
the repository.

To run ROSMAV, run the following commands, each in their own terminal
window:

	roscore

	rosrun ardrone_brown ardrone_driver

	brown-ros-pkg-read-only/experimental/drone_teleop/bin/drone_teleop.py

	roslaunch cmvision blobs.launch

	rosrun ROSMAV inspectPresents
