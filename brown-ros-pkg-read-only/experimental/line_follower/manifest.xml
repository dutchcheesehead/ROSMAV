  <description brief="line_follower">
    Follows a line using cliffFrontLeftSignal as a guide.  Will stop if it bumps into anything.  Calibrates initially using cliffFrontLeftSignal (on line) and cliffFrontRightSignal (off line).  You'll probably want a teleop to steer the robot onto the line after calibration (or, you can place it by hand).
