<h2>Learning from Demonstration</h2>
<h3>Human-Robot Interaction</h3>
</center>
<p>Hello!  Thank you for agreeing to participate in our experiment.
Before you begin, here's a few words to explain what it is we're
hoping to accomplish.</p>
<p>You will be given control of a mobile robot, and you are trying to
teach it how to navigate a simple maze.  It will not attempt to move
itself during the trial, but it _is_ paying attention to how you move,
in response to what you see, and trying to learn what to do from that
information.</p>
<p>When you click on the link below, you will be given control of the
robot and some way of seeing your environment, determined at random.
You may be getting a direct camera feed, in which case you will be
able to see the robot's environment directly.  Otherwise, you may be
provided with a depiction of what the _robot_ is able to see.  This
will be much less familiar and probably more difficult for you to
interpret.  Each leg of the maze has been marked with a
black-and-white tag, and these markers are all that the robot is able
to see.  You will have to navigate based on the markers alone.</p>
<p>So what is the point?  If you are using your own eyes to make sense
of a scene, you're seeing all kinds of things that a robot cannot.
And if it can't see them, how can it learn from them?  On the other
hand, you're likely to be much better at demonstrating how to get
through the maze if you can see what you're doing, and maybe the robot
will learn more from competent demonstrations.  We're interested in
probing that tradeoff.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On the next page, you will be seeing a video feed from the robot's
camera.  You can control its motion with your arrow keys -- forward,
backward, left and right.  You have a map of the maze, and you will be
able to see the tags -- 0, 1, 2 and 3.  If you get the whole camera
feed, then you will also be able to see everything else -- the walls
of the maze, the floor, etc.  Your job is to navigate the robot
through the maze as quickly and adeptly as possible.  If you run into
the walls of the maze, the screen will flash red.  When you reach the
goal, click on the "I'm finished" link, and you will receive a score
based on how quickly and cleanly you navigated the maze.  And
thanks!</p>
