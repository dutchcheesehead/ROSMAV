This is ROS node that implements SOGP (Sample Online Gaussian Process) algorithm.
Contains SOGP code by Dan Grossman and newmat library

The node listens to following topics:
AddMatrix - receives training data in form of matrices of predictor and target variables. 
            Pair of predictor/target matrices is represented by the AddMatrix message;
            This is a preferred method to traing the node if there is a large amount of training data.
AddVector - receives training data in form of a single datapoint. Every datapoint is contains predictor and target
            datapoint. It is represented by a AddVector message


The node advertizes following services:
Reset         - resets the node to its initial state, so it can be trained with new data
PredictVector - make a prediction for a single datapoint. Request contains predictor datapoint. Response contains
                a predicted value
PredictMatrix - make a prediction for a number of datapoints, represented in form of matrix. Request contains a set 
                of predictor datapoints (matrix). Response contains a set of predictions.
Any response from these methods also contains an error description field. If an error occured during the operation, that
field contains a error description in form of string.


Typical usage scenario should be following
1. Set parameters for width, capacity, noise, inputDimension, and outputDimension using rosparam or a launch file.
2. Train the node by sending training data to AddMatrix/AddVector topics.
3. Call PredictVector/PredictMatrix servers to get a prediction for a data

Please look at sogp_test.launch and sogp_ros/sogp_test.cpp for an example of usage.
