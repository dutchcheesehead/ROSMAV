  <description brief="virtual_border">

    Receives velocity commands and relays that information along, so long as the robot is not touching a (high light intensity) border.  When a border is reached, this controller reverses the last issued velocity command until the robot is off of the high-intensity line, thereby preventing its escape.
    A threshold is passed in as a command-line argument.  Any intensity reading of at least this threshold will be counted as on the border.
