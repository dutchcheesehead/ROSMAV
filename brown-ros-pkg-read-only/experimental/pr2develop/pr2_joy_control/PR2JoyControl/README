PR2JoyControl ROS node - user guide

version 1.0.                            Alex Tarvo, 04/18/2010


1. General information

    The node is designed to control PR2 robot using a joystick or a joystick-like
control device, e.g. gamepad controller. In fact, using an gamepad controller is
a preferred method of input because of a large number of DOFs that can be 
controlled with it. Current configuration that comes with the node is pre-
programmed to use gamepad similar to one used on XBOX or PS2/3.
    The PR2JoyControl node is implemented using C++ and depends on following 
ROS nodes:
- std_msgs  - standard ROS messages library;
- roscpp    - ROS C++ runtime;
- joy       - ROS node that captures joystick information and transmits 
them to the /joy ROS topic;
- BrownJoyControlBase - ROS node that contains a base class for any node designed
for controlling a robot with a joystick;
- pr2_controllers_msgs - messages used to communicate with those PR2 controllers
that were created by WillowGarage;
- actionlib - interface to action library to control robot's head;
- PR2JointController - PR2 joint-space real-time controller that was developed
specifically for use with PR2JoyControl node;
    PR2JoyControl is fully configurable and allows assigning various robot 
actions to any buttons or axes of the joystick.
    Overall schema of operation is following:
- joy package gets data from the joystick and publishes them into the /joy
ROS topic;
- PR2JoyControl listens to the /joy topic and reads all the messages. Based 
on robot actions assigned to each button/axis, it decides what to do. Robot's 
base and grippers are controlled through standard controllers developed in 
WillowGarage. These controllers are communicated through corresponding topics:
/base_controller/command - for head, /r_gripper_controller/command and 
/l_gripper_controller/command - for right and left grippers correspondingly.
Arms are controlled through the pr2_joint_controller, developed at Brown 
specifically for this purpose. Head is controlled using head action client. 
- corresponding controllers (arms, head, grippers and base) listen to 
appropriate topics, through which commands are sent. When they receive a command,
this command is executed.

2. Building the node

    Please use rosmake to build the PR2JoyControl package.It is recommended to 
build all the dependent packages first to make sure their dependencies are
satisfied. In fact, joy package has a number of external dependencies, so it
is wise to make sure they are all satisfied first.

3. Controlling the robot
    PR2JoyControl controls allows to fully control backwards/forwards robot 
movement and turn left/right. It also controls robot's head and arms in the 
joint space, so operator must control every robot's joint separately using a
axis or button. It might require some little practice, but control is straight-
forward if a good gamepad is used.
    Every button or axis is mapped to a specific robot's actions. However, PR2 
has a high number of DOF, and even a sophisticated controller might not have
a sufficient number of buttons/axes to control them all. So we create a number 
of "configurations" - different mappings of commands to buttons/axes. Currently
we allow having two configurations. User can switch between those using buttons,
e.g. in our gamepad we button 9 enables configuration 1, and button 10 enables
configuration 2. Configuration 1 is used to control robot's base and head move-
ment, and configurtion 2 is used to control its arms.

4. Action mapping

    Before running the node, we have to assign robot's actions to button and
axes. This is done using ROS parameters. Below we will guide you through the 
parameter namespace and parameters assignment. Examples assume that a DualShock 
controller (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock for details and images)
with 6 axes and 12 buttons is used. You might be using a different controller
though.
    PR2JoyControl uses local namespace for all the parameters. An
example of parameter configuration for DualShock controller is provided in the
PR2JoyControl.launch launch file.
    First, we have to set parameters of the controller - the number of buttons, 
axes and configurations. For now, the number of configurations cannot exceed 2.
The number of axes/buttons must be equal to the numbers of actions/buttons on
the controller. To do this, we have to set following parameters
    NumConfigurations
    NumButtons
    NumAxes
for the number of configurations, buttons and axes correspondingly.
    We also need to adjust axes sensitivity. When touched, every axis sends 
a number (-1,1) proportional to the angle on which the axis is deflected. We do 
not want to react to very small angles since the user might have touched 
corresponding control accidentally. Thus if the number is less than a sensitivity
threshold, no command is issued. The sensitivity threshold is specified using a
AxesSensitivity parameter.
    Now we can specify mapping of joystic buttons/axes to robot commands. There
is a predefined set of commands that can be assigned. As we said, buttons can 
only send  "1" if the button is pressed and "0" otherwise, and axes will send
a number from (-1, 1) range. Thus some of these commands can be assigned only 
to buttons, and some - only to axes (since axis gives additional information).
Mappings have a form

    <parameter name> <command name>

<parameter name> stays for the name of the ROS parameter that defines a button
or axis on the controller. They have following syntax:
    Config<config. no>/Axis<axis no>  - for axes
    Config<config. no>/Btn<button no> - for buttons

<command name> is the name of the robot's command mapped to this axis/button.

Examples:
    Config0/Axis3 axis_move - maps forward/backward movement commadn to the 
axis3 if the configuration 0 is selected;
    Config1/Axis0 axis_lshoulderroll - maps right arm shoulder roll control to 
the axis 0 if configuration 1 is selected;
    Config1/Btn0 relbowflexright - maps "flex right elbow left" command to the
button 0 if configuration 0 is selected;
    Config1/Btn11 rgraspcommand - maps "close/open right grasper" command to
the button 11 if the configuration 1 is selected;

How parameter names are created:
    The first element of the parameter name is the name of the configuration -
either Config0 or Config1. Then actual name of the axis or button follows which 
is formed as Axis<number> or Button<number>. Numeration of number of buttons 
starts from 0.
    Sometimes it is not trivial to determine what number the actual button has.
To do this, we recommend you to run joy node and then listen to that node using
"rostopic echo /joy" command. Press a button and/or move the axis, and the 
rostopic will print out arrays of axes/button values.

5. Running

    We didn't have an actual PR2 in our hands, so we had to verify this node on
a simulator. 
    To control PR2 using NaoJoyControl node, please run following ROS nodes.
a) make sure that roscore is running;
b) run PR2 simulator;
c) run PR2JointController controller:
    - enter the PR2JointController directory;
    - run runPR2JointController script;
d) On the PC to which the controller is attached, run joy node: 
    - rosrun joy joy_node
e) if necessary, modify controller parameter by editing PR2JoyControl.launch file:
f) run PR2JoyControl node:
    - roslaunch PR2JoyControl.launch

6. Notes on implementation
    In fact, all this program is doing is mapping joystick buttons/axes to robot 
actions. This functionality is implemented in the BrownJoyControlBase class, which,
in turn, is defined in the BrownJoyControlBase.h file in the BrownJoyControlBase
ROS package. BrownJoyControlBase is responsible for reading configuration and 
building mappings of joystic controls to robot action codes (which are integers).
This mapping is done during the node startup, when Initialize() method is called. 
During Initialize() both commands are mapped and also the node connects to ROS
topics through which it can control the robot.
    PR2JoyControlNode class is derived from BrownJoyControlBase. Inter-
nally, commands are represented as numeric codes - members of CommandCodes enum. 
String command codes (ones that are set using rosparam) are stored in the 
m_arrConfigCommandStrings array. IT IS IMPORTANT that for every command, 
value of the numeric command code should be equal to the index of the corres-
ponding string in the m_arrConfigCommandStrings.
    After Initialize(), the Run() method is called. Run() enters the loop, during 
which it constantly cals SendCommandToRobot() method. This method is checking if 
new commands have been issued, and, if so, is sending commands to the robot. Some
command messages are sent to the robot constantly, e.g. arm or base motion commands.
However, if the user takes no actions, the command is "void", namely it does not
require the robot to take any actions. But when the user uses a joystick, the
JoystickCallback callback function is called. JoystickCallback scans the state
of all the joystick controls. For every button/axis it calls OnCommandReceive 
function. That function forms a command that will be send to a robot. 
    The program has been tested both on Gazebo and it works fine there. However 
we did not have a chance to try this node on a live robot. Also, there is a small 
chance that some commands that are not listed in the PR2JoyControl.launch file 
might be forcing the robot to take an action in the wrong direction (e.g. instead 
of turning the hand rightwards it will turn it leftwards). In this case the user 
can try to change sign of the values assigned to the m_dblXXXX variables in the 
corresponding "case" statement of the OnCommandReceive function.
