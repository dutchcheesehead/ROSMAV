Adding new images:
1. Place the image named "imageName.png" in the icons folder.
2. Look for the comment "// (Add more icons here)" in overhead_map.js, and add your image, following the format.  (Your addition will look something like: "'icons/imageName.png'," (no double-quotes).)
3. ...
4. Profit! (You can now pass the string "imageName" as a name in om_msgs, along with the typical image tuple, and your image will be drawn on the field at that location.)

General guidelines:
* PNG only
* Transparency will render correctly
* Stay around 75x75 pixels for images, so that they match the size of irobot-create.
* Make sure your image is correctly rotated; look at irobot-create.png is and mimic that.
