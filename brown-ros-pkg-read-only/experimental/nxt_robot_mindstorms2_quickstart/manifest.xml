  <description brief="nxt_robot_mindstorms2_quickstart">

This is the "quickstart" robot design specified in the Lego Mindstorms 2.0 NXT (8547) kit user guide.  I am unsure what robot.ldr, robot.lxf, and robot.urdf do, so they remain unchanged from nxt_robot_sensor_car.  However, the robot appears to do fine with teleoperation as-is.  Sensors are attached as recommended in the user guide.

(Many thanks to Melonee Wise for the nxt_robot_sensor_car node, which I modified to create this node.)
